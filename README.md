## 🔻 Card Layout: Windmill Formation (Right-Rotation)

Instead of using the layout described in Tarot Talismans by Chic Cicero & Sandra Tabatha Cicero (which features a triangle with a central card), this ritual arranges the cards in a windmill-like spiral formation, rotating clockwise from the top.

- **Highlights the main intention (Card 1)** at the top
- **Allows subtle presence** of the other 3 cards
- **Saves altar space**, suitable for modern environments
- **Helps confirm the memorized intent** without distraction
- Acts as a **symbolic mirror** of mental alignment and commitment

> This layout invites the magician to carry the full ritual narrative in memory, reinforcing clarity of purpose.
- Card 1: The purpose of the journey (The Fool)
- Card 2: Seeking permission (Queen of Cups)
- Card 3: Integration path (Two of Wands)
- Card 4: Outcome and transformation (The Magician)
